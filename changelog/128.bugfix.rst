Fix bug where coordinate transforms did not support arrays of coordinates or times. To so support both integrated (e.g. images) and instantaneous (e.g. coarse flare flag) a new property `obstime_end` was added to `~stixpy.coordinates.frames.STIXImaging` when set if possible mean pointing and position information are use for transformations other wise they are interpolated between the two nearest data points.
